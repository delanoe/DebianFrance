# debian.org DNS

For most zones the hidden primary is draghi, with ravel, senfl, klecker
and orff being the public facing secondaries.

Domain information lives in a git on draghi, and pushing to it will cause
the zone to be compiled and reloaded automatically.  Repository lives at
ssh://dns.debian.org/git/domains.git - public read only mirror available
using http.

Some subdomains (and when I say subdomains, I really only mean www) are
served by the geodns setup on geo1, 2, and 3.  They have a seperate repo
ssh://dns.debian.org/git/dsa-geodomains.git and an entirely seperate workflow.

At least it's consistent.

# DNSSEC

Adding DNSSEC KSK and ZSK for zones is done by running
/srv/dns.debian.org/bin/maintkeydb with the following options:

./bin/maintkeydb create both NSEC3RSASHA1 default your.ip6.arpa

Use RSASHA1 instead of NSEC3RSASHA1 for IPv4 address space.

After that a "; wzf: dnssec = 1" needs to be added to the zone file.

## DLV

In order to publish our trust anchors in the ISC DLV, add
"; dlv-submit = yes" to the zonefile, then run the dlv-submit-many script
in /org/dns.debian.org/dlv-sync.

In order to authenticate our control of that zone to ISC you'll have to
manually add a DLV cookie to the respective zone.  After adding it you either
need to wait a day or so for ISC to re-check by themselves (re-run the script
for status information) or trigger a re-check on their website.

Once they have verified the cookie it can be removed from the zone again.
