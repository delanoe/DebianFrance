HP iLO systems do https.

we have our own ilo-CA for them.  To create a new cert, fetch the
CSR, then use the sign-modified-csr script in the CA-ilo dir on our CA host.
(currently db.debian.org:/srv/ca.debian.org/CA-ilo)  The CA password is in
dsa-passwords in the ca file.

If we have a complete management network, add the hostname from that to
the cert also, for instance gluck-ilo.debprivate-ftcollins.debian.org.  If
the iLO has a public internet hostname or even just an IP address that we
sometimes use to access it, add that too.

There are also two scripts that let you fetch CSRs from the iLO and push
a cert to the iLO without going through the web interface.  You can find
them next to the sign-modified-csr in the dsa-misc git repository, or
on the CA host.
