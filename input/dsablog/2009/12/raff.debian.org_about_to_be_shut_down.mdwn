We are re-purposing raff.debian.org as a new security mirror to be
shipped to South America. The raff.debian.org most of you have used as
[buildd.debian.org](http://buildd.debian.org) in the past will cease to exist in the near future.

raff.debian.org will cease acting as a dns server for the debian.org
zone in a few days, therfore we will add two new hosts, senfl.d.o and
ravel.d.o.

All other services formerly hosted on raff.d.o should have been already
moved by now, we just want to encourage those of you who had a login on
raff, to backup your home directory if you care of the data stored there,
as we will not move that.

Current plan is to shut down current raff by end of the year (so in about
7 days).
