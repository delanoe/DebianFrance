I [recently](http://dsa.debian.org/dsablog/2009/06/Setting_up_GeoDNS_for_security.debian.org/)
blogged about the GeoDNS setup we plan for
[security.debian.org](http://security.debian.org).  Even though all DSA
team members agree that the GeoDNS setup for security.debian.org should
come alive as soon as possible, we still fear to break an important
service like security.d.o.

Yesterday I decided without further ado to float a trial balloon and
converted DNS entries for [the Debian Project homepage](http://www.debian.org)
to our GeoDNS setup. While doing so, we found out that some part of our
automatic deployment scripts still need to be adjusted to serve more
than one subdomain of the project.

That setup is live for about eighteen hours now, and the project
homepage now resolves it IPs via GeoDNS. For now, we are using senfl.d.o for
Northern America, www.de.debian.org and www.debian.at for Europe and
klecker.d.o for the rest of the world. From what I can see from GeoDNS
logs, it seems to work fine, and the load stays reasonably low, so
after a short test period we might add additional services like
security.debian.org to GeoDNS.
