While setting up GeoDNS for parts of the debian.org zone, we set up a
new subzone <code>security.geo.debian.org.</code> This was mainly due to
the fact we didn't want to mess up the existing zone while experimenting
with GeoDNS.

Now that our GeoDNS setup has been working for more than half a year
without any problems, we will drop this zone.

We will do that in two phases.

## Phase 1 
Beginning on July 1st, we will redirect all requests to
<code>security.geo.debian.org</code> to a static webpage indicating that
this subzone is deprecated and should not be used any more. If you
still have security.geo.debian.org in your apt sources.list, updates
will fail.
 
## Phase 2
On August 1st, we will stop serving the subzone
<code>security.geo.debian.org</code> from our DNS servers.

## Conclusion
In case you use a <code>security.geo.debian.org</code> entry in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list,</code> now is the best time to change that
entry to <code>security.debian.org</code>. Both zones currently serve
the same content.
