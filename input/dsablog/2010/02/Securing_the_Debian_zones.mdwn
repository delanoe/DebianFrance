We are in the process of deploying
[DNSSEC](http://www.dnssec.net/),
the DNS Security Extensions, on the Debian zones.  This means properly
configured resolvers will be able to verify the authenticity of information
they receive from the domain name system.

The plan is to introduce DNSSEC in several steps so that we can react
to issues that arise without breaking everything at once.

We will start with serving signed <code>debian.net</code> and
<code>debian.com</code> zones.  Assuming nobody complains loudly enough
the various reverse zones and finally the <code>debian.org</code> zone will
follow.  Once all our zones are signed we will publish our trust anchors
in [ISC's DLV Registry](https://www.isc.org/solutions/dlv), again in
stages.

The various child zones that are handled differently from our normal
DNS infrastructure
(<code>mirror.debian.net</code>,
<code>alioth</code>,
<code>bugs</code>,
<code>ftp</code>,
<code>packages</code>,
<code>security</code>,
<code>volatile</code>,
<code>www</code>)
will follow at a later date.

We are using bind 9.6 for [NSEC3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5155) support and
[our](http://git.debian.org/?p=mirror/Net-DNS-SEC-Maint-Key.git)
[fork](http://git.debian.org/?p=mirror/Net-DNS-SEC-Maint-Zone.git)
of RIPE's
[DNSSEC Key Management Tools](http://www.ripe.net/disi/dnssec_maint_tool/)
for managing our keys because we believe that it integrates nicely
with our
[existing DNS helper scripts](http://git.debian.org/?p=mirror/dns-helpers.git),
at least until something better becomes available.

We will use NSEC3RSASHA1 with key sizes of 1536 bits for the KSK and
1152 bits for the ZSK.  Signature validity period will most likely be
four weeks, with a one week signature publication period
(cf. [RFC4641: DNSSEC Operational
Practices](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4641)).

Zone keys rollovers will happen regularly and will not be announced in
any specific way.  Key signing key rollovers will probably be announced
on the
[debian-infrastructure-announce](http://lists.debian.org/debian-infrastructure-announce/)
list until such time that our zones are reachable from a
[signed root](http://www.root-dnssec.org/).  KSK rollovers for our own
child zones (www.d.o et al.), once signed, will not be announced because
we can just put proper
[DS records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#DS)
in the respective parent zone.

Until we announce the first set of trust anchors on the mailinglist the
keysets present in DNS should be considered experimental.  They can
be changed at any time, without observing standard rollover practices.

Please direct questions or comments to either the debian-admin or, if
you want a more public forum, the debian-project list at
lists.debian.org.
